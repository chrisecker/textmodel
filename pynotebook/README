pynotebook
==========


Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a command shell for interactive computing following the
"notebook" concept. Notebooks originally appeared with the program
Mathematica and became famous for python with the iPython/Jupyter
project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c
extensions or anything except python and wx. It is a python module,
runs out of the box and therefore is easy to embed and distribute.

Most notable features of pynotebook are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- matplotlib plotting
- BSD-license


There are a couple of demo applications: 
- a plotting demo
- a notebook interface to gnu r

The later demonstrates how to completely modify the notebook. It uses
rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for colorization.

Basic usage
-----------

::

    >>> from pynotebook.nbview import NBView
    >>> import wx
    >>> app = wx.App()
    >>> frame = wx.Frame(None)
    >>> view = NBView(frame)
    >>> frame.Show()
    >>> app.MainLoop()
