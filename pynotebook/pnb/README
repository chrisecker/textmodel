Introduction
------------

Pnb is an interactive environment for python programming which
follows the notebook concept of mathematica and jupyter. Notebooks are
a pleasant way to develop and document python code and to store ideas.

Unlike other python notebook applications such as jupyter or spyder,
pnb is very lightweight, easy to install and can be embedded in
applications.


Features
--------

Most notable features are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- introspection (F1-key)
- built-in graphics
- plotting via matplotlib
- BSD-license


Pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except
python and `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_. Pynotebook runs
completely out of the box.
