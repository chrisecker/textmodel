Text Model
==========

A data type for storing and manipulating rich text data. It aims to be
fast and efficient and it is suited even for very large texts. 

Quick example
-------------

::

    >>> from textmodel import TextModel
    >>> text = TextModel(u'Hello World')
    >>> text2 = TextModel(u'!', fontsize=20)
    >>> text.insert(11, text2)
    >>> text.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')
    >>> for i in range(1000):
    ...     text.insert_text(len(text), "Line %i\n" % i)
    >>> print text.linelength(0)

Introduction
------------

Storing and editing text information is a problem with a long history
in computer science. Known solutions include the `gap buffer
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer>`_ (used by Emacs), the
`piece table <http://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf>`_ (used
by MS-Word) and the `rope data structure
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29>`_ .

The text model uses internally a structure which I named "texel tree"
and which is probably a new approach to the text problem. The goal was
to find a data structure which stores text together with format
information and is

- fast (even when implemented in a scripting language)
- efficient (in memory consumption)
- hierarchic (so that texts can contain tables and math formulas)

The texel tree consists of nodes which are called texels (text
elements). Each texel can have a variable number of child texels
(between 8 and 15), forming a highly branched tree, similar to a
B-tree. Operations to the tree a performed in such a way, that the
tree is kept balanced, i.e. all branches have exactly the same
depth. The texel tree is fast because it allows all text operations
(insert, remove, copy, paste) in logarithmic time. It is efficient
because it stores text on the level of strings and not on the
character level. 

Text model is an interface to the texel tree, hiding all the
complexity of the recursive texel data structure. It is termed "text
model" because in a model-view-controller scenario it would have the
role of the "model". A matching view component is wxtextview
`wxtextview <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxtextview>`_. In
combination they can be used as text editor.


Speed
-----

Note that textmodel is not yet optimized. By saying that the texel
structure is fast, I mean that the time of operations grows only
slowly with the length of the text. I would not be surprised, if the
times could be improved by a factor of 2.

The following table shows how the time needed to insert a line grows
with the length of the text. The text length is measured as number of
text nodes, where each text node holds one line of text, e.g. 50000
means a text with 50 thousand lines of text.

=============== ====================
  # lines        time (milliseconds)
=============== ====================
          1         0.332514
          3         0.379985
          5         0.436915
         10         0.519033
         30         0.596213
         50         0.657198
        100         0.75822
        300         0.843198
        500         0.897312
       1000         0.998324
       3000         1.081806
       5000         1.136462
      10000         1.246638
      30000         1.356982
      50000         1.404089
=============== ====================

As the table shows, the time grows only very little with number of
lines. Ideally, I would expect a logarithmic dependence on text
length. This is especially true for the following:

- inserting strings
- inserting other trees (=paste)
- copying text
- removing text
- calculating index positions from (row, col)-tuples and vice versa
- counting lines



Implementation details
----------------------

The texel tree consists of different kinds of texels: group texels,
character texels, glyphs and containers.

Character texels hold strings of uniformly styled unicode
text. NewLines are a special case of character texels. Groups hold
child elements. The following texel stores the words *Hello world!*
with *world* marked with red.

::

  G[C('Hello'), C('world!', bgcolor='red')] 
  
Each texel has a length, which corresponds to the number of contained
characters. For example, the length of C('Hello') is 5 and the length
of an empty group is zero.

There are also texels for new lines and tabs and a special mark for the end of text. 

Users can introduce new texels, e.g. tables and math formulas.

Each texel has a **weights** attribute. This is a tuple with 3 integer
numbers, where only the first one is actually used by textmodel and
the other two are free to be used in applications. The value
*Weights[0]* is the number NewLines contained in the texel and its
childs. For example in the tree

::

  G[C('Hello'), C('world!', bgcolor='red'), NL]

this is 1 for the group G and the newline itself, but 0 for the two
characters texels. The *weights[0]* data is used by methods as nlines,
linelength, lineend and index2position to efficiently find the newline
texels.
