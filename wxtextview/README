==========

Wxtextview is user drawn widget for the wx toolkit. It has the
functionality of a rich text editor and can handle even very long
texts without beeing slow.

There are two demos showing advanced possibilities of WXTextView:

:notebook.py:

 A notebook interface similar to mathematica / ipython

:math_demo.py:
 
 A demonstration of editing math equations


1. USAGE
========


Running the demos:
------------------

Just cd to the demo directory and execute the scripts. No installation
is needed. External dependencies are textmodel (all demos), wxpython
(all demos) and matplotlib (notebook). The demos were tested on linux,
windows and mac platforms.

::

    $ cd demo/
    $ python demo1.py


Using the wxtextview-widget:
----------------------------

::

    from wxtextview import WXTextView
    from textmodel import TextModel

    import wx

    model = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    model.set_properties(6, 11, fontsize=14)
    model.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')

    # display the texmodel in a view 
    frame = wx.Frame(None)
    view = WXTextView(frame, -1)
    view.model = model
    frame.Show()

    # set cursor and selection
    view.index = 5
    view.selection = 0, 5

    # display the same textmodel in a second view
    frame2 = wx.Frame(None)
    view2 = WXTextView(frame2, -1)
    view2.model = model
